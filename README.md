# Covid-19-positive-case-simulator

This program is a java simulator which can simulate the number of covid-19 cases by passing values.
This simulation is based on :
The death rate when a person catches the virus
The probability of a person cathing the virus when come in contact with the infected
The recovery rate
(NOTE: all these values can be inputed in the program)

In the starting of the simulation, there is one positive COVID-19 entity. All the entities move randomly around the display.
When the positive entity comes in contact with another entity, the other entity becomes positive based on the probability of a person catching the virus.
